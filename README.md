# 🔥 Typo Punisher

**Typo Punisher** is a fun little Python project that *roasts you when you make typos*.  
It helps you improve your typing accuracy — with a bit of humor 😆.

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1. You type something (maybe while coding or writing).
2. The program detects if you made a **typo** using a spell checker.
3. When a typo is detected, it:
   - Sends you a **notification**, and  
   - Delivers a **funny roast or sarcastic message** (customizable).
4. Optionally, it logs your mistakes to help you track progress over time.
